\chapter{Abstract}

\begin{english} %switch to English language rules
When introducing new software in a system, there is often a desire to take over existing data from a foreign system or to provide data to this system. This can and often is realized through the exchange of XML files. With an XML schema such files can be checked and validated.

So as not to have to maintain every change of an interface in the schema, this should be automated as far as possible. In this thesis I want to show what steps are necessary to generate an XML schema from a relational database.
Also a possibility for the extended validation of the XML files is to be offered.
In practice, a prototype has been implemented at \BMD, which should make it easier for the developer to adapt the interfaces.
